**Students:** Xiaofan Liu (#1214xxxx) and Yuewen Ding (#12149112)

**Date:** Nov. 30, 2017

## Targets

Studentsâ€™ decisions making process on future education is influenced by a combination of factors, including but not limited to their past academic achievements, quality of schools, interests and external environment. The key question for policy makers is how we could improve the education environment in the most cost-effective way. Based on a survey conducted in Ohio, safety is the top one concern when choosing schools for their children. It is important to figure out following questions: Does safety (crime rate nearby the location of a school) affect school performances that are considered for choices making? If so, to what extent? Does it have the same effect on students in different aspects (such as ACT score, college enrollment) or by different types of crimes? The targets of this project is to understand the data correlations between performances Chicago high schools and the safety (crime rates) of their locations. All data used in the study is for the 2016-2017 school year (Sep. 1, 2016 to Aug. 31, 2017). The school performance data are 181 high schools in Chicago, and the crime data are case records of the Chicago city.

## Data Preparation

The scripts that were used to prepare all data set areput in this folder, and data files are stored in the [`data`](https://github.com/yuewending/PPHA30550_Final_Project/tree/master/data) folder.

### Performance Data of High Schools

The performance data are from several different portals but they are all from [Chicago Public Schools (CPS)](http://www.cps.edu/) originally. CPS assign each school a unique **School ID** in all different data sets and studies, so it helps us combine variables from multiple files by matching the **School ID**.
