### Targets

Studentsâ€™ decisions making process on future education is influenced by a combination of factors, including but not limited to their past academic achievements, quality of schools, interests and external environment. The key question for policy makers is how we could improve the education environment in the most cost-effective way. Based on a survey conducted in Ohio, safety is the top one concern when choosing schools for their children. It is important to figure out following questions: Does safety (crime rate at school) affect school choices making? If so, to what extent? Does it have the same effect on students of different ethnicity, different ages or different background? Are crimes at school associated frequency and types of disciplinary actions at school? The targets of this project is to understand the data correlations between performances Chicago high schools and the safety (crime rates) of their locations. The study is conducted based on the school profiles and crime records from chicago data portals.
